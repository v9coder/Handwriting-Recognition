Handwriting Recognition

Overview

This project leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to detect handwritten text from images. It demonstrates the ability to process and recognize handwritten alphabets, making it a practical solution for document digitization and automation tasks.

Features

•	Detects and recognizes handwritten text from input images.

•	Trained on the A-Z Handwritten Alphabets dataset for robust character recognition.

•	Utilizes machine learning techniques to ensure accurate recognition.

Technologies Used

•	OCR (Optical Character Recognition): For text detection and recognition.

•	Dataset: A-Z Handwritten Alphabets for training the recognition model.

•	Python Libraries: NumPy, TensorFlow, and related tools for model building and processing.

Usage
1.	Upload an image with handwritten text through the provided interface or specify the image file in the script.
2.	The system processes the image and outputs the recognized text.
   
Future Enhancements

•	Expand dataset to support multilingual handwriting recognition.

•	Integrate a user-friendly GUI for better interaction.
